At Amazon Alexa, I design and implement systems that intelligently choose the right language model for each conversational task. This work directly impacts the responsiveness and accessibility of Alexa for millions of users worldwide.

## Key Contributions

**Intelligent Model Selection**: Developed routing algorithms that balance accuracy, latency, and computational cost to select optimal models for different types of user queries and contexts.

**Performance Optimisation**: Created systems that reduce response times while maintaining high-quality conversational experiences, making Alexa more accessible to users with varying needs.

**Scalable Architecture**: Built infrastructure that handles millions of routing decisions daily, ensuring reliable performance across diverse user interactions.

## Impact

This work directly influences Alexa's ability to provide fast, accurate responses while managing computational resources efficiently. The systems I've developed help make voice assistants more accessible and responsive for users worldwide.

The research combines theoretical advances in model routing with practical engineering challenges of deploying AI systems at scale, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications.
