As a Research Associate, I worked on the EU's SPRING project, integrating conversational AI and robotics to support clinicians and patients with dementia in hospital environments.

## Project Overview

The SPRING project focused on developing accessible dialogue systems specifically designed for people with cognitive impairments. This work required deep understanding of both technical AI challenges and the human factors involved in healthcare applications.

## Key Contributions

**Accessible Dialogue Design**: Developed conversation systems that adapt to the cognitive abilities and communication patterns of patients with dementia, ensuring inclusive and effective interactions.

**Clinical Integration**: Worked directly in hospital environments to understand real-world constraints and requirements, ensuring that AI systems could be practically deployed in healthcare settings.

**Human-Centred Approach**: Prioritised usability and inclusion in system design, focusing on how technology can genuinely support both patients and healthcare professionals.

## Impact

This research contributed to understanding how conversational AI can be designed to be truly accessible and beneficial for vulnerable populations. The work bridged academic research with real-world healthcare applications, demonstrating the importance of human-centred AI design.

The project highlighted the critical need for AI systems that consider cognitive diversity and accessibility from the ground up, rather than as an afterthought.
