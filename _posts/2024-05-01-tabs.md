**Note**: Tab functionality is disabled for GitHub Pages compatibility.

This is how a post with [tabs](https://github.com/Ovski4/jekyll-tabs) would look like in a full Jekyll setup. The jekyll-tabs plugin isn't supported by GitHub Pages.

## GitHub Pages Alternative

Instead of tabs, you can use collapsible sections with HTML details/summary tags:

<details>
<summary>PHP Code</summary>

```php
var_dump('hello');
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>JavaScript Code</summary>

```javascript
console.log("hello");
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Ruby Code</summary>

```ruby
puts 'hello'
```

</details>

## Another example with collapsible sections

<details>
<summary>YAML Format</summary>

```yaml
hello:
  - "whatsup"
  - "hi"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>JSON Format</summary>

```json
{
  "hello": ["whatsup", "hi"]
}
```

</details>

## Other content types

<details>
<summary>Regular Text</summary>

Regular text content goes here.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Quote</summary>

> A quote

</details>

<details>
<summary>List</summary>

Hipster list

- brunch
- fixie
- raybans
- messenger bag

</details>

This approach provides similar functionality while being compatible with GitHub Pages.
