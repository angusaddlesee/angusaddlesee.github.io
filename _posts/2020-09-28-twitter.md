A sample blog page that demonstrates the inclusion of Tweets/Timelines/etc.

**Note**: Twitter embedding features are disabled for GitHub Pages compatibility.

# Tweet

An example of displaying a tweet would go here. In a full Jekyll setup, you could use the [jekyll-twitter-plugin](https://github.com/rob-murray/jekyll-twitter-plugin) to embed tweets directly.

For GitHub Pages, you would need to manually embed tweets using Twitter's embed code or link to them directly.

# Timeline

An example of pulling from a timeline would be displayed here with the jekyll-twitter-plugin.

# Additional Details

For more details on using the plugin visit: [jekyll-twitter-plugin](https://github.com/rob-murray/jekyll-twitter-plugin)

**GitHub Pages Alternative**: You can manually embed tweets by copying the embed code from Twitter's website and pasting it as HTML in your markdown files.
