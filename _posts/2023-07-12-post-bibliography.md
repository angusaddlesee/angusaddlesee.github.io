This post shows how to add bibliography to simple blog posts.

**Note**: Bibliography features are currently disabled for GitHub Pages compatibility. In a full Jekyll setup, you would be able to use [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) for citations and references.

For academic-style posts with full bibliography support, you would need to use a custom Jekyll deployment rather than GitHub Pages.

If you would like something more academic, check the [distill style post]({% post_url 2018-12-22-distill %}).
