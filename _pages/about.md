I build conversational AI that benefits everyone.

My work focuses on making large language model systems fast, accessible, and human-centred — from hospital memory clinics to global voice assistants.

I'm currently an Applied Scientist at **Amazon Alexa**, where I specialise in LLM routing and optimisation. I design systems that intelligently choose the right model for each task, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost to create faster, more reliable experiences for millions of users. This work directly influences Alexa's responsiveness and accessibility.

Before joining Alexa, I worked as a Research Associate in a hospital environment as part of the EU's SPRING project, integrating conversational AI and robotics to support clinicians and patients with dementia. Much of this built on my **PhD in Artificial Intelligence**, where I developed accessible dialogue systems designed specifically for people with cognitive impairments.

Earlier in my career, I delivered machine-learning pipelines for the NHS and Scottish Government, applying data-driven AI to real public-sector problems. Across roles, I've bridged research and real-world deployment with a consistent focus on usability, inclusion, and technical rigour.

I have delivered over **50 invited talks internationally** (Harvard, USC, KTH, BBC, NatWest), co-founded the European and African Conversational AI Summits, and organised multiple academic workshops. I've supervised 60+ students and interns, producing published papers and guiding early-career researchers in human-centred AI.
